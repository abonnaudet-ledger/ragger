# Ragger

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/LedgerHQ/ragger/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/LedgerHQ/ragger)

This library aims at reducing the cost of running code on both Speculos emulator
or on a real device.

It mainly consists on an interface which is implemented by three backends:

- an emulator-only backend, `SpeculosBackend`, which uses
  [`SpeculosClient`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos/blob/master/speculos/client.py)
  to run an app on a Speculos emulator. With this backend, APDU can be send directly,
  without having to connect a device, start a docker or anything.

- two physical backends (although technically they are agnostic, but the
  `SpeculosClient` is superior with an emulator), `LedgerCommBackend` and
  `LedgewWalletbackend`, which use respectively the
  [`LedgerComm` library](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgercomm) or the
  [`LedgerWallet` library](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerctl/) to discuss
  with a physical device. In these cases, the physical device must be started,
  with the expected application *installed* and *running*, and connected to the
  computer through USB.

## Installation

### Python package

Ragger is currently not available on PIP repositories.

To install it, you need to run at the root of the `git` repository:

```
pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ .[all_backends]
```

The extra index is important, as it brings the latest version of Speculos.

### Extras

Sometimes we just need some function embedded in the library, or just one backend. It can be
bothersome (and heavy) to import all dependencies when just one or none are needed.

This is why backends are stored as extra in `ragger`. Installing `ragger` without extra means **it
comes without any backends**.

Extra are straightforward: `[speculos]`, `[ledgercomm]` and `[ledgerwallet]`. In the previous
section, `[all_backends]` was used: it is a shortcut to `[speculos,ledgercomm,ledgerwallet]`.

### Speculos dependencies

If the Speculos extra is installed (to use the `SpeculosBackend`), system dependencies are needed.
[Check the doc](https://speculos.ledger.com/installation/build.html) for these.

## Features

The `src/ragger/backend/interface.py` file describes the methods that can be implemented by the different backends and that allow to interact with a device (either a real device or emulated):

* `send`: send a formatted APDU.
* `send_raw`: send a raw APDU.
* `receive`: receive a response ADPU.
* `exchange`: send a formatted APDU and wait for a response (synchronous).
* `exchange_raw`: send a raw APDU and wait for a response (synchronous).
* `exchange_async`: send a formatted APDU and give back the control to the caller (asynchronous).
* `exchange_async_raw`: send a raw APDU and give back the control to the caller.
* `right_click`: perform a right click on a device.
* `left_click`: perform a left click on a device.
* `both_click`: perform a click on both buttons (left + right) of a device.
* `navigate`: navigate on the device according to a set of navigation instructions provided.
* `navigate_until_snap`: navigate on the device (by performing right clicks) until a snapshot is found and then validate (with both click).
* `navigate_and_compare_until_snap`: same as the previous method but compare screenshots of the flow with "golden" images after the last snapshot is found.

## Examples
### With `pytest`

The backends can be easily integrated in a `pytest` test suite with the
following fixtures:

```python
---------- conftest.py ----------

import pytest
from ragger import Firmware
from ragger.backend import SpeculosBackend, LedgerCommBackend

# This variable is needed for Speculos only (physical tests need the application to be already installed)
APPLICATION = "Path/to/the/application.elf"
# This variable will be useful in tests to implement different behavior depending on the firmware
NANOS_FIRMWARE = Firmware("nanos", "2.1")

# adding a pytest CLI option "--backend"
def pytest_addoption(parser):
    print(help(parser.addoption))
    parser.addoption("--backend", action="store", default="speculos")

# accessing the value of the "--backend" option as a fixture
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def backend(pytestconfig):
    return pytestconfig.getoption("backend")

# Providing the firmware as a fixture
# This can be easily parametrized, which would allow to run the tests on several firmware type or version
@pytest.fixture
def firmware():
    return NANOS_FIRMWARE

# Depending on the "--backend" option value, a different backend is
# instantiated, and the tests will either run on Speculos or on a physical
# device depending on the backend
def create_backend(backend: bool, firmware):
    if backend.lower() == "ledgercomm":
        return LedgerCommBackend(firmware, interface="hid")
    elif backend.lower() == "ledgerwallet":
        return LedgerWalletBackend(firmware)
    elif backend.lower() == "speculos":
        return SpeculosBackend(APPLICATION, firmware)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Backend '{backend}' is unknown. Valid backends are: {BACKENDS}")

# This final fixture will return the properly configured backend client, to be used in tests
@pytest.fixture
def client(backend, firmware):
    with create_backend(backend, firmware) as b:
        yield b

---------- some_tests.py ----------

def test_something(client, firmware):
    client.exchange(<whatever>)
    if firmware.device == "nanos":
        result = <do something specific to NanoS>
    else:
        result = <do something else>
    assert result.status == 0x9000
```

The `client` fixture used to discuss with the instantiated backend is documented
[here](src/ragger/backend/interface.py).

After implementing the tests, the test suite can be easily switched on the different backends:

```
pytest <tests/path>                                               # by default, will run tests on the Speculos emulator
pytest --backend [speculos|ledgercomm|ledgerwallet] <tests/path>  # will run tests on the selected backend
```

The tests of this repository are a basically the same as this exemple, except
the tests run on the three current firmwares (NanoS, NanoX and NanoS+).
